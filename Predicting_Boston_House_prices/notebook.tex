\subsection{Project: Predicting Boston Housing
Prices}\label{project-predicting-boston-housing-prices}

    In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power
of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes
in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that
is seen as a \emph{good fit} could then be used to make certain
predictions about a home --- in particular, its monetary value. This
model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent
who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the
\href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing}{UCI Machine
Learning Repository}. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and
each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for
homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of
this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the
dataset: - 16 data points have an
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}MEDV\textquotesingle{}} value of 50.0. These
data points likely contain \textbf{missing or censored values} and have
been removed. - 1 data point has an
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}RM\textquotesingle{}} value of 8.78. This data
point can be considered an \textbf{outlier} and has been removed. - The
features \texttt{\textquotesingle{}RM\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}LSTAT\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}PTRATIO\textquotesingle{}}, and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}MEDV\textquotesingle{}} are essential. The
remaining \textbf{non-relevant features} have been excluded. - The
feature \texttt{\textquotesingle{}MEDV\textquotesingle{}} has been
\textbf{multiplicatively scaled} to account for 35 years of market
inflation.

In this first section of this project, we will make a cursory
investigation about the Boston housing data and provide our
observations. Familiarizing oneself with the data through an explorative
process is a fundamental practice to help one better understand and
justify ones results.

Since the main goal of this project is to construct a working model
which has the capability of predicting the value of houses, we will need
to separate the dataset into \textbf{features} and the \textbf{target
variable}. The \textbf{features},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}RM\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}LSTAT\textquotesingle{}}, and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}PTRATIO\textquotesingle{}}, give us
quantitative information about each data point. The \textbf{target
variable}, \texttt{\textquotesingle{}MEDV\textquotesingle{}}, will be
the variable we seek to predict. These are stored in \texttt{features}
and \texttt{prices}, respectively.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Calculate
Statistics}\label{implementation-calculate-statistics}

We will calculate descriptive statistics about the Boston housing
prices. These statistics will be extremely important later on to analyze
various prediction results from the constructed model.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following: -
Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}MEDV\textquotesingle{}}, which is stored in
\texttt{prices}. - Store each calculation in their respective variable.

    \end{Verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Feature Observation}\label{feature-observation}

As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing
dataset: \texttt{\textquotesingle{}RM\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}LSTAT\textquotesingle{}}, and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}PTRATIO\textquotesingle{}}. For each data
point (neighborhood): - \texttt{\textquotesingle{}RM\textquotesingle{}}
is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood. -
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}LSTAT\textquotesingle{}} is the percentage of
homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
- \texttt{\textquotesingle{}PTRATIO\textquotesingle{}} is the ratio of
students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the
neighborhood.

** Using our intuition, for each of the three features above, is it
possible that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an
\textbf{increase} in the value of
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}MEDV\textquotesingle{}} or a \textbf{decrease}
in the value of \texttt{\textquotesingle{}MEDV\textquotesingle{}}?We
will try to justify our answer for each.**

** We can build by keeping in mind the following questions. **

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Would you expect a home that has an
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}RM\textquotesingle{}} value(number of rooms)
  of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}RM\textquotesingle{}} value of 7?
\item
  Would you expect a neighborhood that has an
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}LSTAT\textquotesingle{}} value(percent of
  lower class workers) of 15 have home prices be worth more or less than
  a neighborhood that has an
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}LSTAT\textquotesingle{}} value of 20?
\item
  Would you expect a neighborhood that has an
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}PTRATIO\textquotesingle{}} value(ratio of
  students to teachers) of 10 have home prices be worth more or less
  than a neighborhood that has an
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}PTRATIO\textquotesingle{}} value of 15?

    \section{Answer:}\label{answer}

\subsection{RM:}\label{rm}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the value of RM increases the value of MEDV in that neighbourhood
  also increases whereas lower value of RM results in lower MEDV. This
  is because higher number of rooms mean higher square footage and that
  means the house is comparitively bigger and hence the increase in
  price.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LSTAT:}\label{lstat}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If value of LSTAT increases the value of MEDV would decrease and vice
  versa. Since the value of LSTAT is high, this means that the area has
  a higher number of lower class people, which means that the
  neighbourhood is not that good and a bad neighbourhood is definitely
  going to have lower house prices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PTRATIO:}\label{ptratio}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A lower PTRATIO means that there are lesser number of student per one
  teacher in agiven neighbourhood. Generally such a trend is seen in
  rich neighbourhoods where there are more private schools and where the
  number of students in a school are less so that the teachers can
  better mentor each student. Thus lower PTRATIO means high MEDV and
  higher PTRATIO means low MEDV
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Developing a Model}\label{developing-a-model}

In this second section of the project, we will develop the tools and
techniques necessary for a model to make a prediction. Being able to
make accurate evaluations of each model's performance through the use of
these tools and techniques helps to greatly reinforce the confidence in
our predictions.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Define a Performance
Metric}\label{implementation-define-a-performance-metric}

It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without
quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically
done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through
calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other
useful measurement. For this project, we will be calculating the
\href{http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination}{\emph{coefficient
of determination}}, R2, to quantify your model's performance. The
coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in
regression analysis, as it often describes how "good" that model is at
making predictions.

The values for R2 range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of
squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the
\textbf{target variable}. A model with an R2 of 0 is no better than a
model that always predicts the \emph{mean} of the target variable,
whereas a model with an R2 of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable.
Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target
variable, using this model, can be explained by the \textbf{features}.
\emph{A model can be given a negative R2 as well, which indicates that
the model is \textbf{arbitrarily worse} than one that always predicts
the mean of the target variable.}

            \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} Return the score}
            \PY{k}{return} \PY{n}{score}
\end{Verbatim}


    \subsubsection{Goodness of Fit}\label{goodness-of-fit}

Assume that a dataset contains five data points and a model made the
following predictions for the target variable:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
True Value & Prediction\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
3.0 & 2.5\tabularnewline
-0.5 & 0.0\tabularnewline
2.0 & 2.1\tabularnewline
7.0 & 7.8\tabularnewline
4.2 & 5.3\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Run the code cell below to use the \texttt{performance\_metric} function
and calculate this model's coefficient of determination.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Model has a coefficient of determination, R\^{}2, of 0.923.

    \end{Verbatim}

    ** This generates the following questions: ** * Would you consider this
model to have successfully captured the variation of the target
variable? * Why or why not?

** We should bear in mind the following points while answering the above
questions. **

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The R2 score is the proportion of the variance in the dependent
  variable that is predictable from the independent variable. In other
  words:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    R2 score of 0 means that the dependent variable cannot be predicted
    from the independent variable.
  \item
    R2 score of 1 means the dependent variable can be predicted from the
    independent variable.
  \item
    R2 score between 0 and 1 indicates the extent to which the dependent
    variable is predictable. An
  \item
    R2 score of 0.40 means that 40 percent of the variance in Y is
    predictable from X.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    **Answer:* Yes I would consider the model to have successfully captured
the variation of the target variable because the R2 score of 0.923 which
is very close to 1 indicates that the dependent variable can be
predicted from the independent variable with a very high likelihood.*

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Shuffle and Split
Data}\label{implementation-shuffle-and-split-data}

Our next implementation requires that you take the Boston housing
dataset and split the data into training and testing subsets. Typically,
the data is also shuffled into a random order when creating the training
and testing subsets to remove any bias in the ordering of the dataset.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}7}]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} TODO: Import \PYZsq{}train\PYZus{}test\PYZus{}split\PYZsq{}}

\end{Verbatim}


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Training and testing split was successful.

    \end{Verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Training and Testing}\label{training-and-testing}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training
  and testing subsets for a learning algorithm?
\end{itemize}

    **Answer: * As seen above we split the data in such a way that the
training set has 80\% of the data and testing set has 20\% of the data.
This makes sense because as we will train the parameters and hyper
parameters of our model on the higher bulk of data which ensures that
our model generalizes well, which is to say that it neither underfits
nor overfits. Finally after training our model we test that model on the
20\% of the data that was perviously hidden to training to make sure
that our model has indeed generalized well.*

    \begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\subsection{Analyzing Model
Performance}\label{analyzing-model-performance}

In this third section of the project, we'll take a look at several
models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training
data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an
increasing \texttt{\textquotesingle{}max\_depth\textquotesingle{}}
parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity
affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying
criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing
behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone.

    \subsubsection{Learning Curves}\label{learning-curves}

The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model
with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves
of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training
set is increased. Note that the shaded region of a learning curve
denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard
deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets
using R2, the coefficient of determination.

Run the code cell below and use these graphs to answer the following
question.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

    \subsubsection{Learning the Data}\label{learning-the-data}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will try to analyze one of the graphs above and state the maximum
  depth for the model.
\item
  What happens to the score of the training curve as more training
  points are added? What about the testing curve?
\item
  Would having more training points benefit the model?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hint:} Are the learning curves converging to particular scores?
Generally speaking, the more data you have, the better. But if your
training and testing curves are converging with a score above your
benchmark threshold, would this be necessary? Think about the pros and
cons of adding more training points based on if the training and testing
curves are converging.

    **Answer: * The graph chosen by me is the one with max\_depth = 10 * As
shown in the graph initially when there are less data points the testing
score is very less and the training score is very high. As more and more
data points are added the training score remains 1 where as testing
score increases and becomes constant at some point. This suggests that
when we have a maximum depth of 10 for a model, then we are actually
overfitting the data, i.e the model with max\_depth = 10 has a high
variance. * Also as shown in the graph adding more than 150 data points
is not going to do us much good as the testing score remains almost
constant after that and this suggests that our model has reached its
limit. Thus in order to save our resources we should stop adding data
points for this model after certain level of testing score is achieved.

    \subsubsection{Complexity Curves}\label{complexity-curves}

The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that
has been trained and validated on the training data using different
maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves --- one for
training and one for validation. Similar to the \textbf{learning
curves}, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the
uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the
training and validation sets using the \texttt{performance\_metric}
function.

    \subsubsection{Bias-Variance Tradeoff}\label{bias-variance-tradeoff}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model
  suffer from high bias or from high variance?
\item
  How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What
  visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?
\end{itemize}

    **Answer: * When model is trained at max\_depth 1 the model suffers from
high bias, that is the model is underfitting the data. * When it is
trained at max\_depth 10 the model suffers from high variance. As we can
see from the graph, at max\_depth 10 the training score is very
high(almost 1) which suggests that the model perfectly classifies all
the training data, however the validation score is less, infact after
max\_depth = 4, the validation scores decreases continuously with
increasing depths which suggests that our model with max\_depth = 10 has
overfitted the data and does not generalize well and it is due to this
that training score is very high and validation score is very low.

    \subsubsection{Best-Guess Optimal Model}\label{best-guess-optimal-model}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Which maximum depth do we think results in a model that best
  generalizes to unseen data?
\item
  What intuition lead you to this answer?
\end{itemize}

** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the
validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to
the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we
get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And
remember, Occams Razor states "Among competing hypotheses, the one with
the fewest assumptions should be selected."

    **Answer: * Max\_depth of 4 best generalizes the model to unseen data. *
The reason for this is that, if we look at the graph above, the
validation scores for max\_depth \textless{} 4 and max\_depth
\textgreater{} 4 are less than the validation score of max\_depth = 4.
Thus even though the training score of max\_depth = 4 is less than other
depths, this max\_depth = 4 has the highest validation score and it is
the score on unseen data which we are interested in as it gives us the
best information about the generalization of the model.

\subsection{Evaluating Model
Performance}\label{evaluating-model-performance}

In this final section of the project, we will construct a model and make
a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from
\texttt{fit\_model}.

    \subsubsection{Grid Search}\label{grid-search}

    \begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A grid search technique is used to select the best hyper parameters of
  a model.
\item
  When we are working with an SVM model with 'rbf' kernel, when gamma
  and C are zero , the SVM model gives us a linear separating boundry
  which separates clusters of two data points so as to classify them
  correctly. So basically the SVM algorithm gives us weights for every
  feature so as to form that seperating linear boundry and these weights
  are the parameters of the SVM algorithm. The best of these parameters
  can be selected through cross-validation. However at times the data is
  not linearly separable and we need a more complex boundry than a
  linear one. These circumstances are tackled by varying the values of
  gamma and C. These gamma and C are the hyper-parameters of the SVM
  model. Now checking which of these hyper parameters are the best at
  separating the data is bit of a tedious task and this task is taken
  care of by the grid-search method.So consider that we are interested
  in 4 unique values of gamma and 4 unique values of C and we want to
  select from these 8 values which combination of gamma and C would best
  generalize on unseen data. The grid-search technique comes in here and
  what it does is create a gird of 4 X 4 (16 values) combination of all
  of the gamma and C and for each of those combination it will perform
  the cross validation technique to select the parameters or weights of
  the SVM model. Finally in the end from all of the 16 models, whichever
  model has the highest score is selected. Thus instead of selecting
  random values of gamma and C, we used grid search to find the best
  values of hyper parameters along with choosing the best value of
  parameters for an SVM model and in a sense optimized our model by
  selecting the model that has the score. This general techique holds
  for any other learning algorithm.
\end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Cross-Validation}\label{cross-validation}

    **Answer: * The k-fold cross validaion technique divides the data into k
sub parts. For example if k = 5, then the data is divided in 5 parts and
cross validation is done on the 5 sub parts in such a way that each of
the the sub parts is used once as a validation set. At the end of it we
average the results to get our final model. In k-fold cross validation
we train the data k time and in the end the results are averaged. * The
benifit that this technique provide for grid search is that, instead of
using only some part of the data, we are using all of the data to train
the model and this in turn generalizes our model well on unseen data.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Fitting a
Model}\label{implementation-fitting-a-model}

Our final implementation requires that we bring everything together and
train a model using the \textbf{decision tree algorithm}. To ensure that
we are producing an optimized model, we will train the model using the
grid search technique to optimize the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}max\_depth\textquotesingle{}} parameter for
the decision tree. The
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}max\_depth\textquotesingle{}} parameter can be
thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed
to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are
part of a class of algorithms called \emph{supervised learning
algorithms}.

In addition, we will find our implementation is using
\texttt{ShuffleSplit()} for an alternative form of cross-validation (see
the \texttt{\textquotesingle{}cv\_sets\textquotesingle{}} variable).
While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique we described
earlier, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The
\texttt{ShuffleSplit()} implementation below will create 10
(\texttt{\textquotesingle{}n\_splits\textquotesingle{}}) shuffled sets,
and for each shuffle, 20\%
(\texttt{\textquotesingle{}test\_size\textquotesingle{}}) of the data
will be used as the \emph{validation set}. While you're working on your
implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the
K-fold cross-validation technique.

Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn
versions 0.17 and 0.18. For the \texttt{fit\_model} function in the code
cell below, you will need to implement the following: - Use
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html}{\texttt{DecisionTreeRegressor}}
from \texttt{sklearn.tree} to create a decision tree regressor object. -
Assign this object to the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}regressor\textquotesingle{}} variable. -
Create a dictionary for
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}max\_depth\textquotesingle{}} with the values
from 1 to 10, and assign this to the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}params\textquotesingle{}} variable. - Use
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html}{\texttt{make\_scorer}}
from \texttt{sklearn.metrics} to create a scoring function object. -
Pass the \texttt{performance\_metric} function as a parameter to the
object. - Assign this scoring function to the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}scoring\_fnc\textquotesingle{}} variable. -
Use
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html}{\texttt{GridSearchCV}}
from \texttt{sklearn.grid\_search} to create a grid search object. -
Pass the variables
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}regressor\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}params\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}scoring\_fnc\textquotesingle{}}, and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}cv\_sets\textquotesingle{}} as parameters to
the object. - Assign the \texttt{GridSearchCV} object to the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}grid\textquotesingle{}} variable.

    \subsubsection{Making Predictions}\label{making-predictions}

Once a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used
to make predictions on new sets of input data. In the case of a
\emph{decision tree regressor}, the model has learned \emph{what the
best questions to ask about the input data are}, and can respond with a
prediction for the \textbf{target variable}. You can use these
predictions to gain information about data where the value of the target
variable is unknown --- such as data the model was not trained on.

    \subsubsection{Predicting Selling
Prices}\label{predicting-selling-prices}

Imagine that you were a real estate agent in the Boston area looking to
use this model to help price homes owned by your clients that they wish
to sell. You have collected the following information from three of your
clients:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
Feature & Client 1 & Client 2 & Client 3\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Total number of rooms in home & 5 rooms & 4 rooms & 8
rooms\tabularnewline
Neighborhood poverty level (as \%) & 17\% & 32\% & 3\%\tabularnewline
Student-teacher ratio of nearby schools & 15-to-1 & 22-to-1 &
12-to-1\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What price would you recommend each client sell his/her home at?
\item
  Do these prices seem reasonable given the values for the respective
  features?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hint:} We will use the statistics calculated in the \textbf{Data
Exploration} section to help justify our response. Of the three clients,
client 3 has has the biggest house, in the best public school
neighborhood with the lowest poverty level; while client 2 has the
smallest house, in a neighborhood with a relatively high poverty rate
and not the best public schools.

    \textbf{Answer: * } Predicted selling price for Client 1's home:
\$403,025.00

** Predicted selling price for Client 2's home: \$237,478.72

** Predicted selling price for Client 3's home: \$931,636.36

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Yes these price seem reasonable, because as stated above, Client1's
  home has 5 bedrooms and is in a reasonable neighbourhood and the
  poverty percentage is not that high, also the schools in that
  neighbourhood seem reasonable and hence the price of that house is in
  the mid-ranges. Also Client 2's is the smallest of the homes, is in an
  area of high poverty and the ratio of students to teachers is also
  very high, all in all this house does not seem to be in a good
  neighbourhood, it is small and hence it has the lowest price of all.
  Client 3's home is the biggest of all has a very less population of
  poor people around it and has good schools as seen from the student
  teacher ratio and hence its high price is justifiable.
\end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Sensitivity}\label{sensitivity}

An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model
is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new
data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not
appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data
itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to
adequately capture the target variable --- i.e., the model is
underfitted.

    \subsubsection{Applicability}\label{applicability}

    \begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The data was collected in 1978. It is not reasonable to use a model
  trained on a 40 year old data. This is because in 40 years there may
  have been a lot of changes in lot of neighbourhoods. For example. a
  bad neighbourhood may have become good through gentrification, and
  vice versa. In such a circumstance this particular model would predict
  wrong prices for the houses. We also have to take into consideration
  the inflation, the house prices would have increased consistently in
  40 years and hence such a model would seriously undervalue a client's
  home if the prediction is made today.
\item
  The features are also limited. What is a person has a small house in a
  very large area, what if the house is small but is extremly hitech. In
  such circumstances the house of the price would be much higher that
  the price predicted by the model.
\item
  The model also is not good enough to make consistent predictions which
  is visible from the above codeblock. The reason being, the data is
  insufficient and is not representative of the entire population data.
\item
  The data collected was in Boston. Now not all the cities have same
  price of real estate. Metropolitans like Boston New york etc have a
  very high price for small houses whereas the same house size may cost
  substantially less in other smaller cities. Hence this model can be
  used only on Boston and no-where else.
\item
  It is also not fair to judge the price of the house on the basis of
  the neighbourhood. It may happen sometimes that a very good house is
  built in a bad neighbourhood and vice-versa. Under such circumstances
  the model may make some serious mistakes in valuing the prize of the
  house.
